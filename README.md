# Simple-Snake

A very simple implementation of the game "Snake" that makes use of [Rapid](https://github.com/Pencilcaseman/Rapid)

The idea with this project is that you can write code in the "Bot" class to produce an algorithm that is able to play snake as well as possible, though you could just play the game yourself if you wanted to...

## Rules
1. Don't crash into yourself
2. Don't crash into the edges of the screen
3. Don't crash into any walls
4. Eat as many food blocks as possible

## Controls
**WASD** and **ARROW KEYS**
